# PHP
i choose php(scripting language) for this project because it is allows developers to quickly grasp on web development. 
also i have a good experince in PHP and i am [Zend Certified Engineer](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND026905) .

# Laravel
is one of the best frameworks of PHP. It's MVC framework easy to learn and have a lot of packages to speed up the development.

i used [ixudra package](https://github.com/ixudra/curl) because it's provides an easy interface for sending CURL requests and handling the response.

i faced a problem when i used [Guzzle Package](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle),the response that come from [JSON API](https://offersvc.expedia.com/offers/v2/getOffers?scenario=deal-finder&page=foo&uid=foo&productType=Hotel)
429 too many requests. so i used [ixudra package](https://github.com/ixudra/curl) instead of [Guzzle Package](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle)
